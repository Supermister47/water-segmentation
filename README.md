# Water segmentation in static videos

This is an implementation of [P. Mettes, R. T. Tan and R. Veltkamp, "On the segmentation and classification of water in videos"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7294822) using Python with OpenCV and Scikit-learn.

The folder [Segmentacion test](./Segmentacion%20test/) contains the segmented videos used to test the random forest model.
